To distribute the jar file.

1) in intelliJ, Build > Build Artifacts... > Grimoire.jar > Build
2) the jar file sould appear under ./out/artifacts
3) create a folder called Grimoire.
4) in that folder place the jar file and the start script found in ./lib
5) in that folder create another folder called 'lib'
6) inside the new lib folder place the spells.grim file found in ./lib and the OpenCV binary found in ./lib/OpenCV_2.4

Note: in windows the start script you'll use is start.bat, and the OpenCV binary will be libopencv_java2413.dll
in Linux the start script will be start.sh, and the binary will be libopencv_java2413.so
the raspberry pi is the same as linux, accept the binary can be found in the raspberry pi folder
