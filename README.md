# Grimoire

**Grimoire** is an app which allows you to perform actions with the wave of a wand.

#How It Works

**Grimoire** uses a camera, modified to view infrared light, to track the motions of objects that reflect infrared light. So far I've been using it with a magic wand I got at Ollivanders in Universal Studios. Though any reflective object will work with a little trial and error.

#Installation (Linux)

1) Download **Grimoire.zip** located in the root of this repository. 
2) Unzip it to any location you like.
3) Open the terminal, cd into the Grimoire directory you just unzipped,  and add execute permissions to the start script by executing the following

    ```sudo chmod +x ./start.sh```
    
4) Acquiring, modifying, and installing a camera is up to you.
    
Thats It!
